CS181 Practicals

Don't worry about kaggle1.py, you won't have to edit that right now (or maybe at all).

Ridge1.py is where I put the code for all the different learners. A lot of them are commented out (its a mess sorry but I was working on it during late hours) but they are all library functions so you'll have to look them up to understand how they work exactly. The first part of the code works on going through the csv files and putting the relevant data in the numpy arrays, then after that it just

subset.py - this file will go through and break up the big files to create a tinyTrain and tinyTest you can work with. You can adjust the sizes inside, right now it is 35,000 data points in each, I'd recommend scaling this back down to 10,000.

linreg.py - from last pset.
